# human_genetics_final_project
This is for my human genetics final project, which compared [BIP](https://academic-oup-com.ezp2.lib.umn.edu/biostatistics/article/24/1/124/6272946) and [GRACE-AKO](https://bmcbioinformatics-biomedcentral-com.ezp2.lib.umn.edu/articles/10.1186/s12859-022-05016-y). See simulation_study_submit.sh for the .sh script used to batch submit parallel jobs. In the simulation_study.R script, job parallelization is ultimately executed by the mclappy call (mclapply is a function from the parallel package).
